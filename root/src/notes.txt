JWT for basic authentication, OAuth for more complex systems like Sign in with Google
Gonna use OAuth for this project as it has more diversity at its fingertips

Prisma for best practices, scaling and migration to MySQL or Postgres. SQlite for familiarity and less scalable projects
Gonna use Prisma for best practices and possible migration should i choose that route.

REST vs GraphQL. REST for more simple applications. has problems with over/underfetching though.
GraphQL is more complex and has a higher learning curve, however is good for scaling and more complex data relationships.
Gonna use REST for this one due to its simplicity and I dont need to scale right now. Maybe GraphQL in the future?

In memory caching vs Redis. In memory for small projects, Redis for production level and Bigger projects.
Gonna use In memory for obvious reasons.

Logging and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus for collecting the data, Grafana for Visualizing it.
Gonna pair this with Loki, as its made by the same company as Grafana so I can visualize the Logging data too.

Feels like it's gonna be a long but fun project!
